First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
  for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, 
  godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,
  who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
  For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
  who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.
